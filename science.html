<h3 class="head3">History of science</h3>
<p class="para1">
The term <q>science</q> is a Latin word for <q>knowledge</q>: <em>scientia</em>. <br>
What we today refer to as science was until the 1840s called natural <em>philosophy</em> or <em>pre-modern science</em>.<br>
 For a true understanding of where we are in science, one needs to look at what happened in the past.
The history of science can teach us many lessons about how science should and should not be practiced. <br>
It can also help us understand the direction in which science is heading today.<br>
 Without historical perspective, however, you will not fully appreciate what sciences is.<br><br>
